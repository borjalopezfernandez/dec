Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 15 Issued at 2200Z on 15 Jan 2023

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 14/2100Z to
15/2100Z: Solar activity has been at high levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a M6 event observed at
15/0342Z from Region 3191 (N12E40). There are currently 9 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be moderate
with a slight chance for an X-class flare on days one, two, and three
(16 Jan, 17 Jan, 18 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 14/2100Z to 15/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at unsettled to minor storm levels for the past 24 hours.
Solar wind speed reached a peak of 529 km/s at 15/0137Z. Total IMF
reached 11 nT at 14/2351Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached
-10 nT at 15/0610Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous
orbit reached a peak level of 317 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on days one and three (16 Jan, 18
Jan) and quiet levels on day two (17 Jan). Protons have a chance of
crossing threshold on days one, two, and three (16 Jan, 17 Jan, 18 Jan).
