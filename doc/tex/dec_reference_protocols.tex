\section{Introduction}
This section refers to the different protocols \& associated verbs which are supported for both pull and push circulations.


\section{Network Protocols for Pull}

\subsection{Local}
The files from the \hyperref[DownloadDirs]{\textit{DownloadDirs}} are 
pulled using the OS file management operations. 
The files \textit{"downloaded"} into the \hyperref[LocalInbox]{\textit{LocalInbox}} is perfomed using the \hyperlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX}{POSIX} \hyperlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link}{hard-link} operation whenever both configuration items point to the same file-system, otherwise a copy is perfomed.

\section{Network Protocols for Push}

\subsection{HTTP}
PUT

\subsection{WebDAV}
The WebDAV extension of \href{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html}{HTTP}, which is defined in \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918}{RFC4918} allows to rename files so that DEC can make them visible just upon complete upload.

\par
\noindent
Initially the file is uploaded into the \hyperref[UploadTemp]{\textit{UploadTemp}} using the HTTP verb PUT. Upon its successful upload the file is \textit{moved} into the final \hyperref[UploadDir]{\textit{UploadDir}} using the verb MOVE of the WebDAV extension.
