\section{decCheckConfig} \label{decCheckConfig}
 
\begin{verbatim}
== Synopsis

This is a command line tool that checks the coherency of the DEC configuration.
DEC configuration is distributed amongst different XML files. The information set up
must be coherent. This tool ensures that all configuration critical elements are correct.
(All DEC config files must be placed in the $DEC_CONFIG directory). 
So, run this tool everytime a configuration change is performed.

-e flag:

With this option the Interfaces (Entities) configuration placed in dec_interfaces.xml
is checked. As well it is checked the coherency between the dec_interfaces.xml
configuration file and the DEC Inventory (DEC Database).
(Note: if the network link to a given I/F is broken, the tool will not be able to connect and it
will report a configuration error of this I/F).


-i flag:

With this option the Incoming file-types registered in the dec_incoming_files.xml are checked.
Mainly what it is done is to check that the interfaces from a File is retrieved are configured in 
the dec_interfaces.xml file.


-m flag:

With this option the DEC Mail configuration placed in the ft_mail_config.xml is checked.


-s flag:

With this option the DCC Services configured in the dcc_services.xml file are checked.
The check performed with this flag is that the executable set in the command of the service
can be found in the $PATH environment variable.


-t flag:

With this option the In-Trays configured in the dec_incoming_files.xml file are checked.


-a flag:

This is the all flag, which performs all the checks described before.


== Usage
decCheckConfig [--nodb]
-a    checks all DEC configuration
-e    checks entities configuration in dec_interfaces.xml
--nodb no Inventory checks
-i    checks incoming file-types configured in dec_incoming_files.xml
-o    checks outgoing file-types configured in dec_outgoing_files.xml
-m    checks the mail configuration placed in ft_mail_config.xml
-t    checks the In-Trays configuration placed in dec_incoming_files.xml
-l    checks the log configuration
-h    it shows the help of the tool
-u    it shows the usage of the tool
-v    it shows the version number
-V    it performs the execution in Verbose mode
-D    it performs the execution in Debug mode

\section{decCheckSent} \label{decCheckSent}

\begin{verbatim}
== Synopsis

This is a DEC command line tool that lists the contents of the <Upload> directory
corresponding to a given interface configured in interfaces.xml

== Usage
decCheckSent -m <Interface_Name> [-t]
--mnemonic  <MNEMONIC> (mnemonic is case sensitive)
--temp      it shows the content of the <UploadTemp> directory
--Show      it shows all available I/Fs registered in the Inventory
--help      shows this help
--usage     shows the usage
--Debug     shows Debug info during the execution
--version   shows version number

\section{decConfigInterface2DB}

\begin{verbatim}
== Synopsis

This is a Data Exchange Component command line tool that synchronizes the Entities configuration file
with DEC Inventory. It extracts all the I/Fs from the dec_interfaces.xml file and 
inserts them in the DEC Inventory.

As well it allows to specify a new I/F mnemonic to be loaded into the DEC Inventory with 
the "--add" command line option.

== Usage
decConfigInterfaceDB --add <MNEMONIC> | --process EXTERNAL
--add <MNEMONIC>     (mnemonic is case sensitive) add the specified Entity  
--process EXTERNAL   process $DEC_CONFIG/dec_interfaces.xml
--Show               it shows all I/Fs already loaded in the DCC Inventory
--Verbose            execution in verbose mode
--version            shows version number
--help      shows this help
--usage     shows the usage
