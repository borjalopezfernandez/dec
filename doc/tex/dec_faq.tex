		\item[Are the DEC SW dependencies somehow redundant or overalapping (e.g. curl vs. ncftp)] Answer: All DEC SW dependencies rely on maintained SW. The implementation of the different protocol handlers is independent, and therefore can rely on different SW dependencies. The handler of the plain FTP protocols is based on some initial legacy SW which has been updated to deal with obsolescence so the ncftp SW has been maintained for the time being despite the extensive usage of curl in other different protocol handlers.
