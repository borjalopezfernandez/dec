\begin{document}
 
\par
\noindent
This section includes the version history, which is used for reference of the SW this document applies to. The history brings the main updates associated to every version ; it is not meant to be exhaustive but to make every version recognisable.\newline

\par
\noindent
The history does not include all the long heritage associated to this SW ; the starting point is the capacity to install / uninstall different versions seamlessly with the gem installer and therefore the need to quickly identify what is shipped within each version. \newline

\par
\noindent 
In order to check the version which is currently installed the gem command can be used or alternatively execute any DEC command line with the "-v" flag to obtain the information shown below. \newline

\inlinecode{bash}{ \$> gem list | grep dec  }
