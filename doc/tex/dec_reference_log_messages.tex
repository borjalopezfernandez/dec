% Information Log Messages

\section{Information Messages}

\subsection{Scope}
The information messages by DEC SW are meant in general for tracing the nominal performed circulations allowing consumers to monitor them.

\subsection{Index of Messages}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_005]} "interface" I/F: Polling Started
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_050]} "interface" I/F: Polling Completed / No file(s) available for pull	
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_060]} "interface" I/F: Polling Completed / New file(s) available for pull
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_105]} "interface" I/F: "filename" is available
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_110]} "interface" I/F: Downloaded "filename" with size "num\_bytes" bytes
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_115]} Disseminated "filename" into "directory" Intray
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_116]} Compressed "filename" in "method" at "directory" Intray
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_120]} "interface" I/F: Deleting unknown file "filename" available
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_125]} "interface" I/F: Deleting duplicated file "filename" previously received 
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_126]} "interface" I/F: Deleted downloaded file "filename"
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_130]} "interface" I/F: event "name" triggered  	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{[DEC\_005] Interface Polling Start}
\label{DEC005}
This message time tags the start of the polling operation to \textit{pull} files from a given interface. The time to poll and filter the file to be pulled depends on the number of files published, the different rules configured for download or / and verification with the database of previous downloads ; measurements can be done with this message and its conclusion which is flagged by \hyperref[DEC050]{\textit{[DEC\_050]}} or \hyperref[DEC060]{\textit{[DEC\_060]}} message.

\label{DEC050}
\subsection{[DEC\_050] Interface Polling Complete / No File(s) Available}
This message is logged upon completion filtering the files published in the download interface and verification of eventual duplications in the database without any \textit{new} file meeting the download rules. It can be used to measure the time required to perform the filtering operations.

\label{DEC060}
\subsection{[DEC\_060] Interface Polling Complete / New File(s) Available}
This message is logged upon completion filtering the files published in the download interface and verification of eventual duplications in the database reporting there are some \textit{new} files for download. It can be used to measure the time required to perform the filtering operations.

\subsection{[DEC\_105] File Available}
The file referenced in the message met any of the filtering rules defined in the configuration \textit{dec\_incoming\_files.xml} and it is therefore available for download from the interface. This message is logged only when the \textit{--list} mode is used, otherwise the files matching the rules are directly downloaded and logged accordingly. 

\label{DEC110}
\subsection{[DEC\_110] File Downloaded}
The file referenced in the message has been downloaded from the interface and placed into the \hyperref[LocalInbox]{\textit{LocalInbox}} associated to such interface. If the same file is available again at the same interface, the DEC will detect a file duplication condition.

\label{DEC115}
\subsection{[DEC\_115] File Disseminated}
The file referenced in the message met any of the and it has been moved from \hyperref[LocalInbox]{\textit{LocalInbox}} into the Intray(s) matching the first \hyperref[Dissemination rules]{\textit{dissemination rule}}.

\subsection{[DEC\_116] File Compressed}
The file referenced in the message has been compressed according to the \hyperref[Dissemination rules]{\textit{dissemination rule}} \textit{Compress} optional configuration item of the \textit{Intray} entity.

\subsection{[DEC\_120] Unknown File Deleted}
According to the configuration item \hyperref[DeleteUnknownFiles]{\textit{DeleteUnknownFiles}} defined in \textit{dec\_config.xml} configuration, a file available in the \textit{pull} interface, which did not match any filtering rule defined in the configuration \textit{dec\_incoming\_files.xml} has been deleted from the \textit{DownloadDirs} \textit{Directory} of such interface it was present.

\subsection{[DEC\_125] Duplicated File Deleted}
According to the configuration item \hyperref[DeleteDuplicatedFiles]{\textit{DeleteDuplicatedFiles}} defined in \textit{dec\_config.xml} configuration, a file available in the \textit{pull} interface, which has been previously downloaded successfully such interface is considered duplicated and it is removed directly in download directory without downloading it.

\subsection{[DEC\_126] Downloaded File Deleted}
According to the configuration item \hyperref[DeleteFlag]{\textit{DeleteFlag}} defined in \textit{dec\_interfaces.xml} for every interface, the file which has been successfully \textit{pulled} is deleted subsequently.

\subsection{[DEC\_130] Event Triggered}
The message traces some event which has been triggered for a given interface according to the configuration items defined in \hyperref[Events]{Events}.

\subsubsection{Event newfile2intray}
This event is triggered upon successful polling completion (cf. \hyperref[DEC060]{DEC\_060}) which drove dissemination of some files (cf. \hyperref[DEC115]{DEC\_115}).
\begin{verbatim}
[DEC_130] LEAP I/F : event newfile2intray => auxConverter -f /S3/Leap_Second.dat
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Event onreceivenewfilesok}
This event is triggered upon successful polling completion (cf. \hyperref[DEC060]{DEC\_060}) which drove download of some files (cf. \hyperref[DEC110]{DEC\_110}).
\begin{verbatim}
[DEC_130] LEAP I/F : event onreceivenewfilesok triggered => echo %f RECEIVED
\end{verbatim}

% Warning Messages

\section{Warning Messages}

\subsection{Scope}
The warning messages by DEC SW are meant in general for tracing not nominal situations which might eventually require some intervention.

\subsection{Index of Messages}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_301]} Detected duplicated file "filename" already received from "interface" I/F
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_320]} Detected unknown file "filename" available at "interface" I/F
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_330]} "filename" is stuck in "temporal" directory
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_331]} "filename" is stuck in LocalInbox directory		
\end{itemize}

\subsection{[DEC\_301] Duplicated File Available}
The file reported is available again at the \textit{pull} interface ; if the inventory is active, DEC retrieves just once a given file from each interface. This message will be reported during every polling iteration unless the \textit{duplicated} file is removed from the interface.

\subsection{[DEC\_320] Unknown File Available}
The file reported is available in the \textit{pull} interface, but did not match any filtering rule defined in the configuration \textit{dec\_incoming\_files.xml}. This message will be repeated every polling iteration unless the \textit{unknown} file is removed from the interface.

\subsection{[DEC\_330] File Stuck in Temporal Directory}
This warning is associated to error message \hyperref[DEC620]{\textit{[DEC\_620]}} informing that the file was successfully downloaded and stuck in the temporal directory available for contingency recovery.

\subsection{[DEC\_331] File Stuck in LocalInbox Directory}
This warning is associated to error message \hyperref[DEC625]{\textit{[DEC\_625]}} or \hyperref[DEC626]{\textit{[DEC\_626]}} informing that the file was successfully downloaded and stuck in the \textit{LocalInbox} directory of some interface due to problems during dissemination.

% Error Messages


\section{Error Messages}

\subsection{Scope}
The error messages by DEC SW are meant in general for tracing problems encountered during one iteration which prevented the complete termination of any circulation rule.

\subsection{Index of Messages}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_600]} "interface" I/F: Could not perform polling
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_610]} "interface" I/F: Unable to connect to \hyperref[Config_Server]{"Hostname"} with FTP
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_611]} "interface" I/F: reason of the connection failure
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_612]} "interface" I/F: Cannot reach directory defined in any of the the \hyperref[DownloadDirs]{"DownloadDirs"}
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_613]} "interface" I/F: server message associated to the failure associated to the change of directory
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_614]} "interface" I/F: Cannot GET "URL"
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_620]} "interface" I/F: Could not copy "file" into local
"directory"
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_625]} Dissemination failure of "file" into intray
"directory" using mv command
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_626]} Dissemination failure of "file" into intray
"directory" using hard-links command
	\item \textbf{[DEC\_666]} "interface" I/F: Could not download "file"
\end{itemize}


\subsection{[DEC\_600] Failed to Poll Interface}
\label{DEC600}
This message is raised at the end of the interface polling operation to notify failure. Reason should have been previously logged (e.g. \hyperref[DEC610]{DEC\_610}, \hyperref[DEC611]{DEC\_611},etc). Polling elapse time can be computed by referring to the associated \hyperref[DEC005]{DEC\_005} message. 

\subsection{[DEC\_610] Unable to Connect with FTP}
\label{DEC610}
This error is raised when it is not possible to connect to \hyperref[Config_Server]{"Hostname"} with FTP.

\subsection{[DEC\_611] Server Error Message}
\label{DEC611}
This error code can bring different messages associated to the connection failure [DEC\_610] is reporting. Errors can driven by miss-configuration of the \hyperref[Config_Server]{Server} associated to such interface or its unavailability due to network problems.

\subsubsection{Hostname is unknown}
\begin{verbatim}
[DEC_611] LOCALHOST_NOT_SECURE I/F: getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Service not enabled by host}
\begin{verbatim}
[DEC_611] LOCALHOST_NOT_SECURE I/F: Connection refused - connect(2) for 127.0.0.1:21
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Failed authentication}
\begin{verbatim}
[DEC_611] LOCALHOST_NOT_SECURE I/F: 530 Login authentication failed
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{[DEC\_612] Cannot Reach Interface Directory}
\label{DEC612}
Failed to reach one of the \textit{Directory} of the \hyperref[DownloadDirs]{"DownloadDirs"} of a given interface.

\subsection{[DEC\_613] Server Error Message }
The information replied by the server when error condition \hyperref[DEC612]{[DEC\_612]} arises is usually meaningless to understand the root reason to limit the risks of security attacks. It usually is related to file permissions on the server or miss-configuration problems referring to a non existing directory.
\begin{verbatim}
[DEC_613] LOCALHOST I/F: 550 Can't change directory to /a/if/local/: No such file or directory
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{[DEC\_614] Cannot Get URL}
\label{DEC614}
Failed to get the URL associated to one \textit{Directory} of the \hyperref[DownloadDirs]{"DownloadDirs"} of a given interface when using the HTTP protocol.

\subsection{[DEC\_620] Downloaded File not Copied into Final Dir}
\label{DEC620}
The file retrieved from the interface could not be copied into the final directory defined in the configuration. This is usually a problem of file permissions. 

\subsection{[DEC\_625] File Dissemination Failure}
\label{DEC625}
This error is raised when DEC could not disseminate a file into a given \textit{Intray} according to the \hyperref[Dissemination rules]{\textit{Dissemination rules}} using a mv command. This is usually associated to file permission problems of the \textit{Intray} directory.

\subsection{[DEC\_626] File Dissemination Failure}
\label{DEC625}
This error is raised when DEC could not disseminate a file into a given \textit{Intray} according to the \hyperref[Dissemination rules]{\textit{Dissemination rules}} using hard-links. This is usually associated to file permission problems of the \textit{Intray} directory.

\subsection{[DEC\_666] File Download Failure}
\label{DEC666}
This error is raised when DEC could not download a file from a given interface.
