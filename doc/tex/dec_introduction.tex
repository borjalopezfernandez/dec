\section{Purpose \& Scope}
The Data Exchange Component (DEC) is a SW helper to gather, transform, circulate, and archive files autonomously amongst different interfaces. \newline
\par
\noindent
The scope of DEC SW usually lies on the different ICD defined for communication and exchange of data (generally \textit{files}). As such, it relies on different COTS to delegate the implementation of the different protocols supported.

\section{Design Drivers}
This section enumerates a high level overview for the main design drivers that allows DEC to interface efficiently for the configured exchanges:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Flexibility} : the ability to \textit{pull} \& \textit{push} files from configurable interfaces and configurable circulation rules
	\item \textit{Robustness} : this is to perform “atomic” operations during file circulation ; the state for each operation is always known being network errors tolerant
	\item \textit{Performance} : locally by avoiding copy of files, support of file compression mechanisms and finally parallelisation of the circulation to fruit the available network bandwidth
	\item \textit{Resiliency} : to \textit{autonomously} recover from network errors, downtime and eventual glitches
\end{itemize}

\section{Features}
This section enumerates some of the main high-level features offered by DEC.

\section{Download DEC SW}
This section contains the links to download the DEC SW and the \textit{Gemfile} with the definition of the \textit{gem} dependencies. It is necessary to be logged-in with your DEIMOS \textit{gmail} account to \textit{authorise} the download.
